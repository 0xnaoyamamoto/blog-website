<title> Poker3.0: What I Wish for the Future of Poker </title>

<body>
  <p>To begin my story and the future of my journey, I need to tell you some background about myself. I started to play poker when I was 18, and I love it. My favorite format of poker is No Limit Hold'em Poker Tournament, which I learned how to play by reading a book named "All In Startup". I started with a free-to-play online poker site named "Replay Poker" first and then moved to some live home games with real money.</p>
  <p>The experience that I got from live games is way better than the free money on Replay Poker. Even when I started to try some online poker sites with real money, it's still incomparable to live games. I found that there are several factors that online poker can never beat live games, but I wish I could change that. So, in this document, I will lead you all to my point of view through the problems about online poker in my thoughts and how I'm going to change it with my vision.</p>
  <h2>The Pain Point of Online Poker</h2>
  <p>There are 3 main factors about pain point of online poker including transparency, realism, and payment.</p>
  <h3>Transparency</h3>
  <p>First, even though almost every site boasts fancy certifications regarding their random algorithm for managing cards, we can never be entirely sure these websites are legitimate. We might run well most of the time, but when we hit a downswing, questions about their honesty arise. Are they cheating us? Do they have "super users" who always win against us, no matter what cards they hold? The problem isn't whether they are guaranteed by a big audit firm.</p>
  <p>The issue is that we never truly understand how their randomization algorithm works because we never see their code. So, if we want to resolve this dilemma and eliminate some negative perceptions of their platform, they must be honest and public about how they operate their randomization algorithm on their platform, allowing us to audit it ourselves.</p>
  <h3>Realism</h3>
  <p>Secondly, as you might be aware, with our current technology, there are not many affordable options that can provide a stunning experience of playing online poker akin to live game poker. Nowadays, most online poker platforms introduce their games with a 2D interface, which works fine but does not offer a great experience. The issue with online poker’s 2D interface is that everything moves too quickly. Although this might be a viable option for many people who wish to play as much as possible, I believe it's not mentally healthy. Players tend to make poor decisions when they are forced to make rushed decisions.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, there's a psychological aspect concerning money; when you deposit money as chips in a game that appear on screen, it's less likely you'll feel it's your real money. It feels more like in-game currency owned by the casino, leading most people to gamble rather than play solid poker based on fundamentals.</p>
  <p>You might argue that the advent of virtual reality poker, like Vegas Infinity (Powered by Poker Stars), has already addressed our concerns. I must acknowledge that Vegas Infinity has done a commendable job, even though it hasn't introduced a real money option yet. In terms of realism, it solves many issues present in 2D interface online poker.</p>
  <p>However, I'm not a fan of their decision to style the game world more like a cartoon, which doesn't align with my preferences. In my opinion, I would much prefer graphics that resemble real life as closely as possible. Instead of depicting it as a Disney world of poker, we should strive to make it feel as real as we can, capturing the best experiences of a real table in VR as much as possible. This includes facial expressions, conversations at the table, or the feeling of shuffling chips.</p>
  <p>I understand that, with current technology, processing superior graphics on most standard VR headsets is challenging. However, this advancement is essential for us to achieve the level of realism and engagement we desire.</p>
  <h3>Payment</h3>
  <p>This issue poses a considerable inconvenience for most online poker players, as there isn't a global poker platform that allows everyone to participate on equal footing in terms of costs and rules. Restrictions vary widely, limiting payment options depending on the gambling laws of the country in which a player resides.</p>
  <p>For instance, your bank account could be prohibited from making deposits on certain poker platforms, forcing you to use alternative payment methods that may incur additional fees or spreads. These alternatives might include local agencies that operate without legal authorization, potentially exposing you to significant legal risks, including charges related to money laundering. Engaging with such entities not only jeopardizes your financial security but could also impact your legal standing as a citizen.</p>
  <p>You might think I'm exaggerating the risks associated with making payments on online poker sites, especially if you reside in a country that permits online gambling transactions. However, there are several other factors you should take into account, regardless of the legal status of online gambling in your jurisdiction. These include processing times and fees, the importance of maintaining financial privacy, and the implications of taxation on your winnings. Each of these aspects can significantly impact your overall online poker experience, not just in terms of convenience, but also affecting your financial well-being and legal obligations.</p>
